\frametitle{Timers and Synchronization}
\begin{itemize}
\item MPI offers a \emph{barrier} function that blocks the caller until all processes in the communicator have called it
\mint{c}{int MPI_Barrier(MPI_Comm comm)}
that is, the call returns at any process only after all members of the communicator have entered the call.
\item<2-> It can be used together with the \mintinline{c}{MPI_Wait} function to force a synchronization point in the program.
\item<3-> It can be used to regulate the access to an external resource (e.g., a file) in such a way that every processor accesses it in an order way: if you are interested in writing file in parallel you can look at Chapter 13 of the MPI guide\footnote<3->{Message Passing Interface Forum. MPI: A Message-Passing Interface Standard, Version 3.1. \url{https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-3.1/mpi31-report.pdf}, High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS).}
