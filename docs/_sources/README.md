# A Short Introduction to Parallel Computing

This is a brief introduction to parallel computing with MPI that should be done in about ten hours of class in a laboratory.

Some of the ideas behind parallel computing are quickly introduced and MPI's main directives are discussed: blocking and non-blocking point-to-point communications, collective communications, defining custom types.

Some simple examples related to parallel computing are addressed and solved.

The core of the examples is done in C language and in Python.
